# ML for NFL Game Winner Predictions

Simple project adapted from various sources to predict the winner of NFL games using machine learning. This is a combination of Python scripts and Juypter notebooks.

## Using the Model

To first generate the model, run the `train.ipynb` notebook. This will generate a `clf.pkl` file that will be used later to predict the winner of games.
